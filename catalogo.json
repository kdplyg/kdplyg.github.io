Instructions: To solve the puzzles in this book, you only need a pencil or a pen and a lot of desire to have fun and learn. The puzzles are divided into two types: mazes and sudokus. Here we explain how to solve each one of them: Mazes: A maze is a labyrinth that has an entrance and an exit. The objective is to find the path that connects the entrance with the exit, without passing through the walls or the obstacles that are in the labyrinth. To solve a maze, you can use the method you prefer, such as following the right hand, the left hand, the wall method or the rope method. You can also use your intuition and your sense of direction. When you find the path, mark it with your pencil or pen and check the solution at the end of the book. Sudokus: A sudoku is a puzzle that consists of a 9x9 cell grid, divided into 9 regions of 3x3 cells. The objective is to fill in the empty cells with the numbers from 1 to 9, so that each row, each column and each region contains the nine numbers without repeating. To solve a sudoku, you can use logic, deduction, elimination and other techniques that help you place the numbers correctly. When you fill in all the cells, check the solution at the end of the book.\" Read more",
